# UB Dining

Ever wanted to just ask your assistant if a dining location on-campus is open or closed? Do you want to know what is the menu for your dining center today or any particular date? Then this is just the skill you would want to enable.

UB Dining skill enables Alexa to answer your questions about the on-campus dining experience at University at Buffalo (UB). You can do the following things with this skill:

- Ask what is open on-campus today or any particular date. You can even ask what places are open in a specific area like North (SU), South, Ellicott, Governors (Govs) and Downtown.

- Ask if your favorite dining location is open or not like Perks, C3, Moes to name a few.

- Ask about the current menu or the menu for any particular date. You can even ask for specific menus like breakfast/brunch, lunch, and dinner. Only the Crossroads Culinary Center (C3), Governors Dining Hall (Govs) and Main Street Market Dining Center support the menu feature.
